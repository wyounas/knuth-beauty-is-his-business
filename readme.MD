# A Simple Program Whose Proof Isn’t

I accidentally stumbled upon the book *Beauty is Our Business: A Birthday Salute to Edsger W. Dijkstra*, edited by W.H.J. Feijen et al. This book is a tribute by Dijkstra’s friends and colleagues who were influenced by his work.

The preface shares a quote by Dijkstra that inspired the book’s title:

> “…when we recognize the battle against chaos, mess, and unmastered complexity as one of computing science’s major callings, we must say that ‘Beauty is our business.’”

While skimming through the table of contents, I came across a contribution by Donald E. Knuth titled *“A Simple Program Whose Proof Isn’t.”* I thought it would be fun to explore—and it sure was.

This repository contains Knuth’s code from that article, converted to Python3.
